Using GeoJSON data provided from the United Staes Geological Survey (USGS), a map is created using Leaflet that plots each earthquake from the past week based on
their longitude and latitude. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with
higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. A legend is included to signify the magnitude.
